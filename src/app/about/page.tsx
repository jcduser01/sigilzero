                SIGIL.ZERO is an arcane-tinged electronic music imprint built
                for producers, DJs, and listeners who care about impact, intent,
                and longevity. The label specializes in high-utility,
                buy-on-sight releases—records designed to work on real
                dancefloors, hold up over time, and earn trust through
                consistency rather than hype.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                Sonically, SIGIL.ZERO leans into the darker, hypnotic, and
                industrial edges of techno and adjacent underground forms.
                Releases prioritize DJ usability, physicality, and tension:
                tracks that cut through a system, lock a room, and reward repeat
                plays. If it doesn't function as a club track, it doesn't ship.

                  In its current phase, SIGIL.ZERO is focused on building a
                  small, uncompromising catalog and establishing a clear sonic
                  and visual language. That means fewer releases, higher
                  standards, and hands-on collaboration. Artists released on the
                  label are treated as contributors to a larger signal—not
                  content to be churned.

                <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Demo submissions are not always open. When they are, submission
                  details will be published clearly and intentionally. Unsolicited
                  demos sent outside those windows are unlikely to be reviewed—not
                  out of arrogance, but out of respect for focus and curation.

                  disciplined sound design, deliberate aesthetics, and records
                  made by people who live inside the culture they're
